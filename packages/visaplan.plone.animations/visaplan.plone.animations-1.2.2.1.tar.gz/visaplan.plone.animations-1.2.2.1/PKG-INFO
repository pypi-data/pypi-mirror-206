        A dexterity-based content type for animations.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Provides a `FolderishAnimation` content type which ...
        - *contains* it's specific (Javascript, most likely) resources, while
        - using more generic (library) resources, common for all animations of a common
          type, from a "global" resource path
        - Currently we have exactly *one* type, tailored to our CreateJS_-based
          animations.
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        This add-on can be seen in action at the following sites:

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Sorry, we don't have real user documentation yet.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Add visaplan.plone.animations_ to your buildout_::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
        
            eggs =
                ...
                visaplan.plone.animations
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``; or add it to the requirements of your own
        extension or policy package.
        
        After (re-) starting your Zope instance, you'll need to "install" the
        extension, using the extensions installation form or the Zope quick-installer.

        To do
        =====
        
        - Create integration tests
        - Support *various* types of animations
        - Support creation of animations by upload of an achive file
          (e.g. ``.zip`` or ``.tar.gz``)
        - Fully integratable animations (which don't need an HTML page on their own)
        - Static thumbnails:
        
          - Remove *hard* dependency on visaplan.plone.staticthumbnails_
          - Fix the ZCA_ wiring to obsolete the inheritance from the mixin class
        
        Contributions welcome!

        1.2.2.1 (2023-05-03)
        --------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - When checking the version of the visaplan.plone.search package,
          compare correctly, following `PEP 440`_.
        
        Requirements:
        
        - packaging_
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.2.2 (2023-05-02)
        ------------------
        
        Improvements:
        
        - As we use the traditional index `getExcludeFromNav`, we import the
          name of that index from visaplan.plone.search now, if available;
        - The default is still ``getExcludeFromNav``.
        
        Requirements:
        
        - importlib_metadata_
        - If we have visaplan.plone.search, we need 1.7+
        
        Hints:
        
        - The default value for the `getExcludeFromNav` index name
          will change in a future release.
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.2.1 (2023-04-19)
        ------------------
        
        Profile changes:
        
        - Optional upgrade step to version 1005: refresh index `getExcludeFromNav`
          for FolderishAnimation objects.
        
          If you don't have that index (the *canonical* name is `exclude_from_nav` instead),
          just skip this step; an appropriate indexer is provided (but not activated) by
          visaplan.plone.search v1.6.2+.
        
        Requirements:
        
        - If visaplan.plone.search is installed, we need v1.6.2+,
          for a suitable `getExcludeFromNav` indexer.
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.2.0 (2022-09-20)
        ------------------
        
        New Features:
        
        - getThumbnailPath for FolderishAnimations:
          .dx.FromImageAttribute with customized default thumbnail
        
        Requirements:
        
        - visaplan.plone.staticthumbnails v1.2.0
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.1.3 (2022-03-04)
        ------------------
        
        New Features:
        
        - If visaplan.plone.structures is installed, the ``@@landing_path`` of
          FolderishAnimations points to the appropriate ``@@info`` path.
          Requires visaplan.plone.structures v1.2.7+.
        
        Requirements:
        
        - If visaplan.plone.menu is installed, we need v1.1.1+,
          for the ``@@mainmenu.current_topic_path`` method.
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.1.2 (2021-11-17)
        ------------------
        
        New Features:
        
        - ``@@landing_path`` view for FolderishAnimation objects
          (no solution for target=_blank yet)
        
        Requirements:
        
        - If we have visaplan.plone.search, it must be v1.4.7+,
          providing the `ILandingPath` interface.
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.1.1 (2021-09-07)
        ------------------
        
        New Features:
        
        - if visaplan.plone.industrialsector is installed, we'll have
          a ``code_formatted`` metadata column;
          with v1.1.2+, it should be created using the right language.
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.1.0 (2021-06-30)
        ------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Thumbnail generation works now, using visaplan.plone.staticthumbnails.mixin.dx.DedicatedThumbnailMixin
        - Profile bugfix for ``Folder.xml``, ``allowed_content_types``:
          attribute `purge=False` was missing
        
        Profile changes:
        
        - Added behavior IDedicatedThumbnail
        - Added upgrade step to reload the profile
        - Increased profile version to 1004
        
        Requirements:
        
        - visaplan.plone.behaviors v1.1.0+
        - visaplan.plone.staticthumbnails v1.1.0+
        
        - Removed dependencies on
        
          - visaplan.plone.ajaxnavigation_
          - visaplan.tools_
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.5 (2021-02-16)
        ------------------
        
        New Features:
        
        - `FolderishAnimation.getCustomSearch` method, providing (for now):
        
          - portal_type
          - Creator
        
        Profile changes:
        
        - Upgrade step to update the ``getCustomSearch`` indexes
        - Profile version increased to 1002
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.4 (2020-12-16)
        ------------------
        
        Improvements:
        
        - Made FolderishAnimations clickable even if lacking a preview image
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.3 (2020-03-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Views for AJAX navigation support (based on visaplan.plone.ajaxnavigation_)
        - Added an ``ajax-nav`` view to prevent Plone from trying to load a FolderishAnimation via AJAX
          (since this doesn't work yet).
        - Since it is not usable as an AJAX navigation target,
          the ``embed`` view has been renamed to ``onlyme``
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.2 (2019-10-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed *profile* dependency on visaplan.plone.behaviors, since the current version 1.0.2 doesn't have one.
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2019-06-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Support for preloader images, recognized by name
        - use visaplan.plone.staticthumbnails_
        - Add CSS classes to HTML text
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0 (2019-05-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
