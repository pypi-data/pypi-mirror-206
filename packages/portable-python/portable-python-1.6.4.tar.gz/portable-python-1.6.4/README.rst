This project is a python CLI that aims to make compiling portable python binaries automatable.


Supported operating systems
---------------------------

Currently Windows is not supported, contributions are welcome.

Python binaries can be produced as "portable" (statically linked, can run from any folder
where the binary is unpacked in), or with a ``--prefix`` (build targeted to live in a
pre-determined folder, like ``/apps/pythonM.m``)

What is a "portable python"?
----------------------------

It's a binary python distribution (``.tar.gz`` or ``.zip``) that can be decompressed in any folder,
and used from there without further ado (ie: no need to run an "installer" and things like that).

The idea here is to allow for automated systems to:

- Easily obtain a python binary, that can be used in sandboxes / workstations / laptops / instances...

- Have an open source tool that can compile such portable pythons reliably,
  without having to worry about the compilation part.

- Be able to inspect any python installation, and point out how portable it is,
  which shared or non-standard libraries it is using


Guiding principles
------------------

- Focuses on just one thing: compile a portable python, and validate that it is indeed portable,
  produce outcome in (configurable) ``./dist/`` folder and that's it

- Only the last few non-EOL versions of python are supported (no historical stuff)

- As time goes on, the code of this tool will evolve so that the latest pythons keep building
  (but won't worry that older versions still keep building)

- C compilation is done as simply as possible: no "patching" of any sort,
  rely solely on the upstream make/configure scripts, typically via stuff like ``--enable-shared=no``

- Builds are validated, an important part of the effort was to write up code that is able to
  ``inspect`` a python installation and detect whether it is portable or not (and why not if so).

- ``cpython`` is initially supported, but aiming to compile any python family in the future
  (pypy, conda, ...)

- Cross-compilation would be cool, but only if upstream supports it
  (ie: only if doable via stuff like ``./configure --host=...`` - no on-the-fly patching allowed)


For this repo itself:

- Code is pure python, it is a CLI with one entry-point called ``portable-python``

  - Can be ran in a debugger

  - 100% test coverage, has a ``--dryrun`` mode to help with testing / debugging / seeing what would be done quickly

  - No shell scripts (those are hard to maintain/test/debug)

  - Can be ``pip install``-ed and reused


Installation
------------

``portable-python`` is a regular python CLI, it can be installed with:

pickley_::

    pickley install portable-python
    portable-python --help


Or pipx_::

    pipx install portable-python


You can also run it directly (without explicit install) with pipx::

    pipx run portable-python inspect /usr/bin/python3


Using ``pip install`` (a CI builder would probably do this)::

    /usr/bin/python3 -mvenv /tmp/pp
    /tmp/pp/bin/python -mpip install portable-python
    /tmp/pp/bin/portable-python --help
    /tmp/pp/bin/portable-python inspect /usr/bin/python3


Invoke a build from python code::

    from portable_python import BuildSetup

    setup = BuildSetup("cpython:3.9.7")
    setup.compile()


Invoke an inspection from python code::

    from portable_python.inspector import PythonInspector

    inspector = PythonInspector("/usr/bin/python3")
    print(inspector.represented())
    problem = inspector.full_so_report.get_problem(portable=True)
    if problem:
        print("oops, it is not portable!: %s" % problem)


From source, contributions welcome!::

    git clone https://github.com/codrsquad/portable-python.git
    cd portable-python
    tox -e venv
    .venv/bin/portable-python --help
    .venv/bin/portable-python inspect /usr/bin/python3

    tox -e py39
    tox -e style


Building a portable cpython
===========================

Once you've installed ``portable-python``, you can get going like so::

    # Build a binary
    cd some-temp-folder
    portable-python build 3.9.7
    ls -l dist/cpython-3.9.7-macos-arm64.tar.gz

    # Unpack it somewhere
    tar -C ~/.pyenv/versions/ -xf dist/cpython-3.9.7-macos-arm64.tar.gz
    ls -l ~/.pyenv/versions/

    # It's ready to be used
    ~/.pyenv/versions/3.9.7/bin/python --version


Note that you can use ``--dryrun`` mode to inspect what would be done without doing it::

    $ portable-python --dryrun build 3.9.7

    INFO selected: xz openssl gdbm (3 modules) xz:5.2.5 openssl:1.1.1k gdbm:1.18.1
    INFO Platform: macos-x86_64
    ...
    --------------
    -- xz:5.2.5 --
    --------------
    Would download https://tukaani.org/xz/xz-5.2.5.tar.gz
    Would untar build/sources/xz-5.2.5.tar.gz -> build/components/xz
    INFO env PATH=build/deps/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
    INFO env MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14
    Would run: ./configure --prefix=build/deps --enable-shared=no --enable-static=yes ...
    ...
    -------------------
    -- cpython:3.9.7 --
    -------------------
    Would download https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.7/Python-3.9.7.tar.xz
    Would untar build/sources/Python-3.9.7.tar.xz -> build/components/cpython
    ...
    Would run: ./configure --prefix=/ppp-marker/3.9.7 --enable-optimizations ...
    Would run: /usr/bin/make
    Would run: /usr/bin/make install DESTDIR=build
    ...
    Would tar build/3.9.7 -> dist/cpython-3.9.7-macos-x86_64.tar.gz


Build folder structure
----------------------

``portable-python`` uses this file structure (build/ and dist/ folders configurable)::

    build/
        ppp-marker/3.9.7/                   # Full installation (after build completes)
        components/                         # Builds of statically compiled extension modules are here
        deps/                               # --prefix=.../deps passed to all component ./configure scripts
        sources/
            openssl-1.1.1k.tar.gz           # Downloaded artifacts (downloaded only once)
    dist/
        cpython-3.9.7-macos-arm64.tar.gz    # Ready-to-go portable binary tarball
