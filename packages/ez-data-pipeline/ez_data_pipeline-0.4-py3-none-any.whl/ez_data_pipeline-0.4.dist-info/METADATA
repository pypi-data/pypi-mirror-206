# Open Data Pipeline

Library meant to improve collaboration and automatically get all necessary libraries and other tools to speed up development. Any architechture changes will occur here. Pycharm seems to be the default IDE.  

# Installing Library 
`pip install .`

# Installation Necessary Project Libraries
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Setting up environment 
This can be taken care by pycharm, but for testing the CI/CD you may want to use VIM<br><br>
[Venv Setup](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)<br>
`... Docker will be added when a good workflow is developed`

# General Contribution Guidelines 

Create a feature branch, try to merge by end of day in order to avoid conflict.
Every major commit will have associated test cases so make sure you use TDD.
You can ask to get invited to the private repository. The private repo will have more advanced ML based models.

# In the works 
 Since this is to facilitate deployment/integration add issues as you see fit. Docker Images will be the next step to 
 automate deployment
