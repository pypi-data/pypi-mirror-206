The **pa-dlna** Python project forwards pulseaudio streams to DLNA devices. It
is based on asyncio and is composed of the following components:

 * The ``pa-dlna`` program forwards PulseAudio streams to DLNA devices [#]_.
 * The ``upnp-cmd`` is an interactive command line tool for introspection and
   control of UPnP devices.
 * A standalone UPnP library used by both commands.

See the **pa-dlna** `documentation`_.

Installation::

  $ python -m pip install pa-dlna

Requirements
------------

Python version 3.8 or more recent.

DLNA devices must support the HTTP GET transfer protocol and must support HTTP
1.1 as specified by Annex A.1 of the `ConnectionManager:3 Service`_ UPnP
specification.

Dependencies
------------

The ``pa-dlna`` command uses the Python packages ``psutil`` and
``pulsectl-asyncio``. They are automatically installed with pa-dlna when
installing with pip.

The ``pa-dlna`` command does not require any other dependency when the DLNA
devices support raw PCM L16 (:rfc:`2586`).

If not, then encoders compatible with the audio mime types supported by the
devices are required. ``pa-dlna`` currently supports `ffmpeg`_ (mp3, wav, aiff,
flac, opus, vorbis, aac), the `flac`_ and the `lame`_ (mp3) encoders. The list
of supported encoders, whether they are available on this host and their
options, is printed by the command::

  $ pa-dlna --dump-default

The  UPnP library  and the ``upnp-cmd`` command depend on the ``psutil``
Python package.

Configuration
-------------

A ``pa-dlna.conf`` user configuration file may be used to:

 * Change the preferred encoders ordered list used to select an encoder.
 * Customize encoder options.
 * Set an encoder for a given device and customize its options for this device.
