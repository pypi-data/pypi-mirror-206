Installation
=================

Install from PyPi
-----------------------

You will be able to install Fireworks using pip (Note: this doesn't work yet.):

::

    pip install pytorch-fireworks

It is recommended to do this from within a virtual environment.

Install from source
-----------------------

For development purposes, you can download the source repository and install the latest version directly.

::

    git clone https://github.com/smk508/Fireworks.git
    cd Fireworks
    pip install .
