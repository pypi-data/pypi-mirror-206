## Optimization of Gold nanocluster

An example optimization of Gold (Au) nanocluster is given in "example" directory. We have used CASTING to optimize the already known global minima (Sutton-Chen) of 13 atom Au nanocluster (Icosahedral structure).  Details on additional examples can be found in [Paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.12106).

## Carbon metastable polymorphs

We have also used CASTING to sample metastable polymorphs of Carbon(C). All the structures are then further relaxed with DFT. The unique polymorphs and their corresponding DFT energies have been provided in “C_polymorphs” directory.
