# `module-utilities`

A Python package for creating python modules.

## Overview

I was using the same code snippets over and over, so decided to put them in one
place.

## Features

- `cached`: A module to cache class attributes and methods. Right now, this uses
  a standard python dictionary for storage. Future versions will hopefully
  integrate with something like [cachetools].

- `docfiller`: A module to share documentation. This is addapted from the
  [pandas `doc` decorator](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/util/_decorators.py).
  There are some convenience functions and classes for sharing documentation.

## Status
