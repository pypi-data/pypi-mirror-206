# bism - Biomedical Image Segmentation Models

This is a collection of generic PyTorch model constructors usefull for biomedical segmentation tasks. 
Something akin to the `timm` package for 2D image tasks. 
When at all possible, each model will offer a 2D or 3D implementation, however we will not provide pre-trained model files.
