# Installing ImagingWin 
- Windows 10:
The remote control functionality is only enabled in specifically the v 2.51 exe version of the ImagingWin program. 
Due to this and ImagingWin supporting Windows 10 only on version >=2.56 the following steps must be taken to allow for remote control on Windows 10 systems: Install ImagingWin =2.56 as usual from Walz IMAGING-PAM download site. After installation: Make copy of the ImagingWin.exe file located in the installation folder. Overwrite the ImagingWin.exe in the installation folder with the v 2.51 exe provided with PACMan. 

# To use
