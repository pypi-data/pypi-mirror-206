VPSolver
--------
VPSolver is a vector packing solver based on an arc-flow formulation
with graph compression. VPSolver generates very strong models that can
be solved using general-purpose mixed-integer programming solvers such
as Gurobi and GLPK. For modelling other problems easily, VPSolver
includes a Python API and a modelling toolbox (PyMPL).

Setup
`````

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pyvpsolver
