"ASCE"



'ASCE' is a simple program that operates on matrices.
Some of the operations are:add, substract, multiply,triangle_inf, triangle_sup,
determinant,trace,inverse...


The purpose of this project is to find an algorithm that can multiply matrices with a better time 
complexity than the normal code(Strassen)
P.S: We implemented these functions in a class called "matrix" so before calling any function we need to write  matrix.function(),
except for the multiplication, addition and substraction, we just use the maths operations "+, -, *"
