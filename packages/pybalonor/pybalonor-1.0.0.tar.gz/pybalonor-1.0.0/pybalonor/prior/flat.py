    Flat prior of the log-normal distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    l0_min : float
        Minimum :math:`l_0` within the prior support.
    l0_max : float
        Maximum :math:`l_0` within the prior support. Has to fulfill
        :math:`\,l_0^\\text{max} > l_0^\\text{min}`.
    l1_min : float
        Minimum :math:`l_1` within the prior support. Has to fulfill
        :math:`\,l_1^\\text{min} \geq 0`.
    l1_max : float
        Maximum :math:`l_1` within the prior support. Has to fulfill
        :math:`\,l_1^\\text{max} > l_1^\\text{min}`.
