# for python2.7 just uses Python 3.12 (no indication of
# this is provided ot the user)
#
# Fortunately there are no deps, and little use is made of
# env variables in testing, so python 2 and iron python can 
# just be tested in a global installation if needs be.  
#
# A work around for this using invoke to run the tests instead
# of tox is in the pipeline.
