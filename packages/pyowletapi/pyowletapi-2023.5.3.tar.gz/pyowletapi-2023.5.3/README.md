# Introduction

First pass at creating a wrapper for the Owlet baby monitor api, this currently only supports the sock v3 as I do not have a v2 to test with

inspiration and API reverse engineering taken from various projects:

https://github.com/BastianPoe/owlet_api

https://github.com/mbevand/owlet_monitor


End goal is to create a homeassistant integration using this API. But the intention is that this library will always be usable standalone

## Install
To install via pip run command 

```
pip install pyowletapi
```

## To do
Tidy up exception logging

Create test routines

## Use
import the base Olwet object 

```python
from pyowletapi.owlet import Owlet
```

create an Owlet object passing your region, username and password

```python
owlet = Owlet('europe', username, password)
```

you can then authenticate against the Owlet servers using this object and get a list of devices (as sock objects)

```python
await owlet.authenticate()
devices = await owlet.devices()
```

to get current reading from sock call the update_properties function on each sock object
```python
device.update_properties()
```
This will return a tuple, the first element being the raw response as a dict and the second element is a more cut down dict version of the response showing only the most relevant data.
