# Lens by Credo AI - Responsible AI Assessment Framework

Lens is a comprehensive assessment framework for AI systems. 
Lens standardizes model and data assessment, and acts as a central gateway to assessments 
created in the open source community. In short, Lens connects arbitrary AI models and datasets
with Responsible AI tools throughout the ecosystem.

Lens can be run in a notebook, a CI/CD pipeline, or anywhere else you do your ML analytics.
It is extensible, and easily customized to your organizations assessments if they are not 
supported by default. 

Though it can be used alone, Lens shows its full value when connected to your organization's 
[Credo AI App](https://www.credo.ai/product). Credo AI is an end-to-end AI Governance
App that supports multi-stakeholder alignment, AI assessment (via Lens) and AI risk assessment.

- Sphinx (optional for local docs site)
