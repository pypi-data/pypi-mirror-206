# The Score-P Python Jupyter Kernel
This is the Score-P Python Kernel that enables you to execute Python code in Jupyter Notebooks with [Score-P](https://score-p.org/).

The kernel is based on the [Score-P Python bindings](https://github.com/score-p/scorep_binding_python).

## Installation

**For using the kernel you need a proper Score-P installation.**

To install the kernel and all dependencies use: 

```
pip install scorep-jupyter
python -m scorep_jupyter.install
```
The kernel will then be installed in your active python environment.
You can select the kernel in Jupyter as `scorep-python`

## Usage

### Configuring Score-P in Jupyter
You can set up your Score-P environment by executing a cell that starts with the `%%scorep_env` magic command.

You can set the Score-P Python binding arguments by executing a cell that starts with `%%scorep_python_binding_arguments`.

### Executing Cells 
Cells that should be executed with Score-P have to be marked with `%%execute_with_scorep` in the first line. Cells without that command are executed as ordinary Python processes.

### Multi Cell Mode
You can also treat multiple cells as one single cell by using the multi cell mode.

Therefore you can mark the cells in the order you wish to execute them. Start the marking process by a cell that starts with the `%%enable_multicellmode` command.
Now mark your cells by running them. Note that the cells will not be executed at this point but will be marked for later execution.
You can stop the marking and execute all the marked cells by running a cell that starts with `%%finalize_multicellmode` command.
This will execute all the marked cells orderly with Score-P. Note that the `%%execute_with_scorep` command has no effect in the multi cell mode.

There is no "unmark" command available but you can abort the multicellmode by the `%%abort_multicellmode` command. Start your marking process again if you have marked your cells in the wrong order.

The `%%enable_multicellmode`, `%%finalize_multicellmode` and `%%abort_multicellmode` commands should be run in an exclusive cell. Additional code in the cell will be ignored.

### Write mode

Analogous to [%%writefile](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#cellmagic-writefile) command in IPykernel, you can convert a set of cells to the Python script which is to be executed with Score-P Python bindings (with settings and environment described in auxillary bash script).

Running a cell with `%%start_writefile` magic command will begin the write mode, `%%end_writefile` will subsequently end it.  Running other cells in the write mode will add their contents to the Python script or its environment instead of executing them. Specifically:

- Recording a cell containing `%%scorep_env` or `%%scorep_python_binding_arguments` will add the environment variables/Score-P Python bindings to the bash script.
- Code of a cell which is not to be executed with Score-P (not inside the multicell mode and without `%%execute_with_scorep`) will be framed with `with scorep.instrumenter.disable()` in the Python script to prevent instrumentation.
- Other cells will be recorded without any changes, except for dropping all magic commands.

Note that `%%abort_multicellmode` will be ignored in the write mode and will not unmark previous cells from instrumentation.

By default, the Python script will be called `jupyter_to_script.py`. You can also specify the name by providing it as an argument to the start magic command, e.g. `%%start_writefile myscript.py`.

## Presentation of Performance Data

To inspect the collected performance data, use tools as Vampir (Trace) or Cube (Profile).

## Future Work

The kernel is still under development. The following is on the agenda:
 
 - Check alternative Python implementations (Stackless/PyPy) for better serialization support
 - Performance data visualizations
 
PRs are welcome.

## General Limitations 

* For the execution of a cell, the kernel uses the default IPython kernel. For a cell with Score-P it starts a new Python process. Before starting this process, the state of the previous executed cells is persisted using dill library. However, there is no support for the following objects: frame, generator, traceback
In the future there might be support for alternative Python implementations (Stackless or PyPy) in order to support serialization of these objects.

* when dealing with big data structures, there might be a big runtime overhead at the beginning and the end of a Score-P cell. This is due to additional data saving and loading processes for persistency in the background. However this does not affect the actual user code and the Score-P measurements.
