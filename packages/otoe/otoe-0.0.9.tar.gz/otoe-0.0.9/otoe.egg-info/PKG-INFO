# otoe

Command line tool to parse md files to espanso config.


## Motivation

As a reviewer at Yandex.Praktikum I have tons of predefined comments for students. It's super uncomfortable to edit in espanso yamls especially, when you need some markdown. So, now I don't have to. This tool will handle it for me.

## Goals
- md files -> yaml in order to maintain 
- espanso match yaml -> md files for people how store their snippets in yamls directly with some basic support of vars feature


## Usage

1. Install via pip(idk if it will work or not)

```
pip install otoe
```

2. set env vars:

`MD_DIR` - directory where your markdown notes are stored
`YAML_DIR` - direcotry where yaml files will be saved (if not set yamls will be stored in `$MD_DIR/yamls`)


3. MD_DIR structure

```
markdown_files
  dir1
    file.yaml
    file1.yaml
  dir2
    file2.yaml
    file3.yaml
  dir3
    file.yaml
    file2.yaml
  file.yaml
```

4. Markdown file structure

Each file should consist two parts: text and yaml devided by separator `====`

```markdown
here is the text

====
trigger: keyword
```

Text part(above separator) will be used as replace value and everything under separator should be a valid yaml and will be used as is.
Example above will be converted to espanso match like this:

```yaml
trigger: 'keyword'
replace: 'here is the text'
```

if you need to use vars feature you can do it as well:

```
Date: {{date}}

====
trigger: :year
vars:
	- name: year
	  type: date
	  params:
	    format: "%Y"
```

will be parsed to

```yaml
replace: 'Date: {{date}}'
trigger: :year
vars:
	- name: year
	  type: date
	  params:
	    format: "%Y"
```
