# PyPI name uses dashes not underscore because google IAM role doesnt allow underscore
# Couldn't get it completely consistent though:
#
#     * PyPI name: google-ssl
#     * Tool CLI command: google-ssl
#     * Google IAM service account (doesnt allow underscore): google-ssl-rotator
#     * Google Cloud function (accepts both underscore and dashes): google-ssl-rotator
#
# However, the package name is underscored because importing package requires it.
#
#     import google_ssl
