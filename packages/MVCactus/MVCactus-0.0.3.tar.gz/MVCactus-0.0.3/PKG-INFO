MVCactus is a lightweight, open-source web framework for building small web applications in

files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files. MVCactus also includes a simple file uploader and validator for 
processing file uploads from HTML forms.

MVCactus is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend. It is suitable for building small web applications and 
prototypes, as well as for learning the basics of web development in Python.
