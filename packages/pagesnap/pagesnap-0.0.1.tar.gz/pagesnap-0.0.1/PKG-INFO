# PageSnap

[中文文档](./README_zh.md)

PageSnap is a tool that allows you to save web pages offline as single-page HTML files, preserving the original appearance of the web page as much as possible. It is developed using Python and Playwright, which means it can also save dynamic JavaScript web pages offline.

The advantage of using single-page HTML format is that users can conveniently open and browse the files with any W3C-compliant browser.

As a Python library, PageSnap can be easily added as a dependency to other projects. If your project uses Python and Playwright, simply import the PageSnap library to add offline-saving capabilities to your pages.

Note: Currently, this project is still in the early stages of feature development and cannot be directly used as a library. The related APIs are still under development. You can keep an eye on the progress, or feel free to clone the project to try it out and share your thoughts.
