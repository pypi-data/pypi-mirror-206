def auto_populate(AIM):

    Automatically creates a performance model for PGA-based Hazus EQ analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    AIM: dict
        Asset Information Model - provides features of the asset that can be 
        used to infer attributes of the performance model.

    Returns
    -------
    AIM_ap: dict
        Extended Asset Information Model - extends the input AIM with additional
        features that were inferred. These features are typically used in 
        intermediate steps during the auto-population and are not required 
        for the performance assessment. They are returned to allow reviewing 
        how these latent variables affect the final results.
    DL_ap: dict
        Damage and Loss parameters - these define the performance model and 
        details of the calculation.
    CMP: DataFrame
        Component assignment - Defines the components (in rows) and their 
        location, direction, and quantity (in columns).
