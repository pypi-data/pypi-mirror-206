## Overview
CryptoRL will use popular deep reinforcement learning algorithms and machine learning algorithms to do cryptocurrency trading.

## Installation

Run ```pip install cryptorl``` to install CryptoRL.

## Getting started

To fetch data, please use the functions in *data.py*.

For example:

```fetch_single('2020-01-01', '2022-01-01', 'aapl')```

will return a DataFrame object that containing the cleaned data with required ticker and range of dates.

With well processed data, you can use *env_crypto.py* to construct crypto market environment.

Read the [documentation](https://cryptorl.readthedocs.io) for more details.
