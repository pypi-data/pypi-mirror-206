GenPackageDoc Description
=========================

The Python package **GenPackageDoc** generates the documentation of
Python modules. The content of this documentation is taken out of the
docstrings of functions, classes and their methods.

It is possible to extend the documentation by the content of additional
files either in reStructuredText (RST) format or in LaTeX format.

The documentation is generated in four steps:

1.  Files in LaTeX format are taken over immediately.
2.  Files in reStructuredText format are converted to LaTeX files.
3.  All docstrings of all Python modules in the package are converted to
    LaTeX files.
4.  All LaTeX files together are converted to a single PDF document.
    This requires a separately installed LaTeX distribution
    (recommended: TeX Live). A LaTeX distribution is **not** part of
    **GenPackageDoc** and has to be installed separately!

How to install
--------------

**GenPackageDoc** can be installed in two different ways.

1.  Installation via PyPi (recommended for users)

    ``` {.}
    pip install GenPackageDoc
    ```

    [GenPackageDoc in PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/GenPackageDoc/)

2.  Installation via GitHub (recommended for developers)

    Clone the **python-genpackagedoc** repository to your machine.

    ``` {.}
    git clone https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-genpackagedoc.git
    ```

    [GenPackageDoc in
    GitHub](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-genpackagedoc)

    Use the following command to install **GenPackageDoc**:

    ``` {.}
    setup.py install
    ```

How to use
----------

**GenPackageDoc** provides a toolchain to generate documentation out of
Python sources that are stored within a repository. **GenPackageDoc** is
also designed to be able to consider setup informations of a repository.

The impact is: There is a deep relationship between the repository
containing the sources to be documented, and the sources and the
configuration of **GenPackageDoc** itself. Therefore **GenPackageDoc**
needs to be configured to get to know about things like the path to the
package sources and the desired name of the generated documentation PDF
file.

**GenPackageDoc** is able to use it\'s own sources to document itself.
Therefore the complete [GenPackageDoc
repository](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-genpackagedoc)
can be used as example about about writing a package documentation.

At the end of all preparations you will get for your own repository a
PDF document that will look like this:
[GenPackageDoc.pdf](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-genpackagedoc/blob/develop/GenPackageDoc/GenPackageDoc.pdf)
(that is the detailed documentation of **GenPackageDoc**).
