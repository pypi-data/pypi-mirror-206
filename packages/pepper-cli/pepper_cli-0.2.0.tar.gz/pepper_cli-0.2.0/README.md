# Getting Started

The recommended way to install pepper, is via pip, with the following command: 

```
pip install pepper-cli
```

If you want a more bleeding-edge release, however, it can be installed from the main GitHub branch with: 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/kevinshome/pepper.git
```

# PEP Basic Info

To get basic information about a PEP (for this example, let's use 683), we would run the command: 

```
pepper info 683
```

Which will return the following:

```
PEP 683 â€“ Immortal Objects, Using a Fixed Refcount

# PEP Search

To search for a PEP (for this example, let's search for "Python 3" in the title), we would run the command:

```
pepper search title "Python 3"
```

Which would return the following:

```

# Viewing a PEP

To view a PEP, there are two options. First, you can open the PEP in a new tab in your default web browser by running: 

```
pepper open 801
```

However, if you install pepper with the `webview` extra, you can use the command:

```
pepper view 801
```

To open an independent webview window, with the PEP page pulled up on it. 

Whichever method you choose, it is recommened to set an alias to it (i.e. `alias pep="pepper view"` for webview). This way, to open PEP 801, you would simply run the command `pep 801`.
