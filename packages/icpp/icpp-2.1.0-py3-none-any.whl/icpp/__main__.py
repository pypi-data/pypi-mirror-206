"""__main__.py
The double underscores indicate that this file has a special meaning in Python.
When running a package (!) as a script with -m, 'python -m icpp', Python
executes the contents of the __main__.py file.

In other words, __main__.py acts as the entry point of our program and takes care of
the main flow, calling other parts as needed
