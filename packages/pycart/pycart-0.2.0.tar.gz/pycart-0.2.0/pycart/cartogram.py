        Runs the Dorling cartogram algorithm and returns the generated cartogram in the form of a GeoDataFrame.

        A Dorling cartogram [[2]](cartogram.md#References) represents each region as a circle, with the
        radius being proportional to the density of the given region. The regions are then moved via a
        gravity-like force model.

        The radius of a given region $J$ is calculated over multiple steps, with Steps 1 and 2 being carried out by
        [`border_util.get_borders()`](border.md):

        1. Use Queen contiguity to find all neighbours of a region $J$; Queen contiguity acts similarly to
        a [Moore neighbourhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood), where a neighbour is a region
        that shares an edge or a vertex.
        2. Assign weights to each neighbour of $J$ based on the length of perimeter that the neighbour occupies.
        3. Calculate the sum $D$, of the pairwise distance (see [`_paired_distance`](cartogram.md#Helpers)) from a region to all of its neighbours, for all regions.
        4. Calculate the sum $R$, of radii as:
        $R = \sum (\sqrt{V_M / \pi} + \sqrt{V_N / \pi})$ for all $N$ neighbours and for all $M$ regions

        5. Calculate the radius scaling coefficient $k$, as:
        $k = D / R$

        6. Calculate the radius of region $J$:
        $r_J = k \sqrt{V_J / \pi}$

        See the helper functions [`_attract()`](cartogram.md#Helpers) and [`_repel()`](cartogram.md#Helpers) for more details on how the forces are
        calculated.

        - **iterations  :  *int, default 100*** - The number of iterations to run the Dorling algorithm for.
        - **ratio  : *float, optional, default 0.4*** - Ratio of attractive force to repulsive force; the larger the ratio, the more attractive force is applied.
