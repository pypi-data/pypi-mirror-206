# Pyterm
_Making an aesthetic minimalist Linux shell in Python_

Welcome to PyTerm! Pyterm is an aesthetic CLI shell for Unix systems written in Python with the Textual framework.

## Features
- Dynamic content swapping
- Saveable configurations and settings
- Standard Linux commands
- All in a text-based interface straight out of Blade Runner

## Installation

To install, use the pip command
```
pip install pyterm-shell
```
Or download from [source].

## Use
To run PyTerm from the pip installation, simply type
```
PyTerm
```
From source, run
```
python3 Main.py
```

## Warnings
**SOME LINUX PROGRAMS WILL BREAK WHEN RUN THROUGH PYTERM**
These include nano, vim, and most programs that require more than basic console output.
Running these programs is considered undefined behavior and can have a range of untested consequences.

Here's a (very) short list of things you shouldn't do in/with PyTerm:
- Run non-console programs
- Modify/delete any of the files PyTerm needs to function

## Conclusion
PyTerm is a cool project that (should) continue to recieve regular updates. If you find any bugs or have any feature ideas, please make a post [here].
