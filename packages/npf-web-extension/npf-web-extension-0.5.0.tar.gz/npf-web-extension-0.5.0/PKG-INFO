# Network Performance Framework Web Extension

This repository is an extension to NPF (<https://github.com/tbarbette/npf>) and should therefore not be used as a standalone tool as the architecture has been built based on npf's internal architecture.

However for more advanced usage, it can be used as a standalone tool. In order to do so, the app has to be initialized by running the following javascript command:

```js
window.updateConfiguration(configurationData);
```

the signature of the `updateConfiguration` method is available inside the `App.tsx` file.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode available at address `http://localhost:3000`

### `npm test`

Will be updated later

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production and optimizes it.

### `npm run eject` -- DO NOT USE

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
This will be removed in the near future
