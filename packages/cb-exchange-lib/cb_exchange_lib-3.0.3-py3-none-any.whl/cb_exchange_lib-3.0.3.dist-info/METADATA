from cb_exchange_lib import Time, Accounts

environment: str = "sandbox"
credentials: dict = {
    "key": "your key",
    "passphrase": "your passphrase",
    "secret": "your secret",
}  # be careful where you keep your credentials!


if __name__ == '__main__':

    print("*" * 80)

    endpoint = Accounts(**credentials, environment=environment)
    accounts = endpoint.get_accounts()

    for account in accounts:
        print(account)

    endpoint.close()

    # or

    with Time(environment=environment) as endpoint:

        print("*" * 80)
        time = endpoint.get_time()
        print(time)
