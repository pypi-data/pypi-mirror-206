endpoint
********


Description
===========

An endpoint is an organizational construct to keep multiple data
connectivity management solutions and their resources (pe-id,
dnsProxyIp, dnsZones, and so on) separate from each other, helping you
to stay organized. For example, you could have separate registries for
development, testing, and production.
