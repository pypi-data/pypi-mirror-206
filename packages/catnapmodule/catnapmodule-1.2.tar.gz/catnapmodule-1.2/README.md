DESCRIPTION
===========

Hi!

This is my first Python module that was made 4 learning.
It contains 2 directories: "queq" and "chat", so, for import it u
need 2 do it like that:

> from catnapmodule import chat

> from catnapmodule import queq 

"Chat" contains 2 functions: .hello():

> from catnapmodule.chat import hello

that takes string and returns other string:

> chat.hello("Name")

    "Hello, Name!"

and .author()

> from catnapmodule.chat import author

that prints who is author of the module.

"Queq" contains functions can make ur 
quadratic equations solved, i mean 4 funcs, 4
different types of it: full, "ab", "ac" and "bc", u
just need to give them 3 r 2 numbers.

Enjoy!^^~
