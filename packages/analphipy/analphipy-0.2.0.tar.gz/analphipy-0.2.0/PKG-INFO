# `analphipy`

Utilities to perform metric analysis on fluid pair potentials. The main features
of `analphipy` as follows:

## Overview

`analphipy` is a python package to calculate metrics for classical models for
pair potentials. It provides a simple and extendable api for pair potentials
creation. Several routines to calculate metrics are included in the package.

## Features

- Pre-defined spherically symmetric potentials
- Simple interface to extended to user defined pair potentials
- Routines to calculate [Noro-Frenkel] effective parameters.
- Routines to calculate [Jensen-Shannon] divergence

## Status

This package is actively used by the author. Please feel free to create a pull
request for wanted features and suggestions!

## Quick start

Use one of the following to install `analphipy`

```bash
pip install analphipy
```

or

```bash
conda install -c wpk-nist analphipy
```

## Example usage

```python
import analphipy

```
