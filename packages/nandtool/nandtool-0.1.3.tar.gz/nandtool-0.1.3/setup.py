    'long_description': '# Nand tool\n\nThis project contains code to do ECC correction for NAND flash. The tool has been created because ECC configurations are varied and can have many options. We want a general tool that can perform ECC corrections on any NAND flash. The configuration of the ECC must be known and should be recorded in a configuration file (`.toml`). \n\nFor each partition in the file system a different ECC structure can be defined and each partition will be mounted on a separate folder of the specified mount point. The mounting is done using fusepy. For a few systems the configuration files are in this repository. If no configuration file is present, the section [Structure of a Configuration File](#Structure-of-a-Configuration-File) explains how a config file should be structured. \n\n\n## Getting started\n\nSet up your Python virtual environment and activate the environment:\n\n```commandline\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource ./venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nInstall the linux dependencies below and install nandtool in the virtual environment:\n\n```commandline\nsudo apt install fuse python3-dev build-essential\npip install nandtool\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo list the available configurations:\n\n```shell\npython3 -m nandtool list\n```\n\nTo use the tool to mount (an ECC corrected) image:\n\n```shell\npython3 -m nandtool mount /image -m /mountpoint -c /config\n```\n\nIf mounting succeeds you will see the log message `"Mounting image /image on mount point /mountpoint with configuration /config"` appear and the process will hang. Navigate to the given mount point with another terminal session or a file browser to access the NAND partitions.\n\nUnmounting can be done from the terminal with:\n\n```shell\nsudo umount /mountpoint\n```\n\nThe logs will show show that the image was successfully unmounted and nandtool will exit.\n\nNote that the partition is not saved to the mount point. Once you unmount, the partitions are removed. If you want to save the partition binaries, you have to do so by hand.\n\n\n## Structure of a Configuration File\n\nThe [example.toml](config/example.toml) shows what a config file should look like and the different sections and parameters are explained in the comments. Setting up the config requires one to know the partitions in the NAND image. How the partion info can be found is discussed in [the next section](#NAND-Partition-Info). \n\nFor the partitions a layout must be defined and the page size is set. The SIMPLE layout shows the required parameters for a parition with ecc correction, and the COMPLEX layout shows the additional optional parameters that can be set. The NOECC layout shows that it is also possible to extract the user data without performing ecc correction. Note that not all partitions in the image have to be listed. The nandtool will only correct and extract the partitions listed in the config file. \n\nThe ordering of ecc bytes and ecc protected data within a page differs greatly per NAND flash. Therefore, this tool allows the user to set per byte whether it is ecc protected data, user data, or ecc code. This is done using intervals. Moreover, a page may be split up into several chunks (usually four) on which error correction needs to be performed separately. For each chunk the intervals need to be defined. \n\nFor example, in the simple layout, we have four chunks of 512 bytes of ecc protected data at the start of the page. The user data is equal to the ecc protected data in this case. The ecc bytes for each chunk are located at the end of the page at offsets 2050, 2064, 2078, 2092, and each 13 bytes long.\nIn the complex layout the protected data bytes are immidiately followed by the ecc bytes, which is repeated four times. Also, the protected data intervals are different from the user data intervals. \n\nIt is also possible to define configurations that do not perform ECC correction, but simply extract the uncorrected user data for instance. In this case simply omit the parameters that define ECC correction. Some configurations without ECC correction are provided and labeled `noecc`.\n\nFeel free to create a merge request if you create configs for systems not yet available in this repo.\n\n\n## NAND Partition Info\n\nOn QNX systems [dumpifs](https://github.com/FrancisHoogendijk/dumpifs) can be used to get insight into the partition table. First, extract the user data from the image without performing the ECC correction. This can also be done with a config file (the ones called `noecc`):\n\n```commandline\npython3 -m nandtool /image -m /mountpoint -c /config\n```\n\nClone the [dumpifs](https://github.com/FrancisHoogendijk/dumpifs) repository and use the tool in the repo. The image in the command below is the file we just mounted with the command above.\n\n```commandline\ndumpifs -x /image -d /output_dir\n```\n\nIn the output directory look for `etc/system/config/nand_partition.txt`. In this text file the offsets (in blocks) of the partitions are given.\n\nOn systems that do not run QNX, finding the partition table may involve manually delving into the binary for the information.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you want develop and contribute to the tool, first fork the repository. Contributions can be submitted as a merge request. \n\nTo get started clone the forked repository and create a virtual environment. Install poetry, necessary linux packages, and dependencies.\n\n```commandline\nsudo apt install fuse python3-dev build-essential\npip install .\n```\n\n',
