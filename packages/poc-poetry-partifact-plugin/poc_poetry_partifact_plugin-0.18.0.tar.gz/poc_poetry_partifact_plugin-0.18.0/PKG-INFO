## POC-POETRY-PARTIFACT-PLUGIN

This project is a poetry plugin that wraps the `poetry add/install` commands and adds some logic
that will authenticate to AWS CodeArtifact under the hood.

Before any poetry `add` or `install` commands are run, this plugin will check the `pyproject.toml` file
for any codeartifact sources.

It is looking for the first `tool.poetry.source` block that contains `.codeartifact.` in its url. 
The required fields are "url" and "name."

If the tool doesn't find any valid source blocks, nothing happens.

## Configuration

Create a `tool.poetry.source` block in your `pyproject.toml` file, then set the "url" to the CodeArtifact repository url, and set the "name" to the id of the AWS profile you'll be using to authenticate.

Here's an example of a valid `tool.poetry.source` block (the `default=true` is optional):
```yaml
[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = "<your-aws-profile-name>"
url = "https://<your-domain-name>-<your-project-id>.d.codeartifact.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/pypi/<your-repo-name>/simple/"
default = true
```

## Installation

To install the plugin, run this command:

```shell
poetry self add poc-poetry-partifact-plugin
```

## Uninstallation

To remove the plugin, run this command:

```shell
poetry self remove poc-poetry-partifact-plugin
```

## Under the Hood

Once the plugin has gotten your repository url and the name of the AWS profile you'll be using, it  uses the AWS profile credentials located at `~/.aws/credentials` to make an API request to your AWS CodeArtifact repository.

If this request is successful, a short-lived token will be returned that will grant temporary access.
This token is set as a [poetry environment variable](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#using-environment-variables) and allows poetry to seamlessly authenticate to the repository.
