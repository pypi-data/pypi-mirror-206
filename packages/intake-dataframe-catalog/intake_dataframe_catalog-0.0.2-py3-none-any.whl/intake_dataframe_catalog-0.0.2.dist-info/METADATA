intake-dataframe-catalog is a simple intake plugin for a searchable table of intake catalogs. The table is represented in memory as a pandas DataFrame and can be serialized and shared as a CSV file. Each row in the dataframe catalog corresponds to another intake catalog (refered to in this documentation as a 'subcatalog') and the columns contain metadata associated with each subcatalog that a user may want to peruse and/or search. The original use-case for intake-dataframe-catalog was to provide a user-friendly catalog of a large number `intake-esm <https://intake-esm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ catalogs. intake-dataframe-catalog enables users to peruse and search on core metadata from each intake-esm subcatalog to find the subcatalogs that are most relevant to their work (e.g. 'which subcatalogs contain model X and variable Y?'). Once a users has found the subcatalog(s) that interest them, they can load those subcatalogs and access the data they reference.
