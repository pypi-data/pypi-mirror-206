Geochemistry π is **a Python framework** for data-driven geochemistry discovery. It provides an extendable tool and one-stop shop for **geochemical data analysis** on tabular data. 

The goal of the Geochemistry π is to create a series of user-friendly and extensible products of high automation for the full cycle of geochemistry research.  

Key features are:
+ **Easy to use:** The automation of data mining process provides the users with simple number options to choose.
+ **Extensible:** It allows appending new algorithms through Scikit-learn with augmented AutoML functionality by FLAML and Ray.

Latest Update: follow up by clicking `Starred` and  `Watch` on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ZJUEarthData/geochemistrypi), then get email notifications of the newest features automatically.

## Quick Installation

One instruction to download on command line, such as Terminal on macOS, CMD on Windows.  
```
pip install geochemistrypi
```
**Note**: The beta version runs on MacOS, Windows or Linux.

## Quick Update
One instruction to update the software to the latest version on command line, such as Terminal on macOS, CMD on Windows. 
```
pip install --upgrade geochemistrypi
```

## Example

**How to run:** After successfully downloading, run this instruction on command line whatever directory it is.

### Case 1: Run with built-in data set for testing
```
geochemistrypi data-mining 
```
**Note**: There are four built-in data sets corresponding to four kinds of model pattern.

### Case 2: Run with your own data set
```
geochemistrypi data-mining --data your_own_data_set.xlsx
```
**Note**: Currently, only `.xlsx` file is supported. Please specify the path your data file exists.

## First Phase
It works as a **software application** with a command-line interface (CLI) to automate **data mining** process with
frequently-used **machine learning algorithms** and **statistical analysis methods**, which would further lower the
threshold for the geochemists.

The highlight is that through choosing **simple number options**, the users are able to implement a completed cycle of data
mining **without knowledge of** SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, FLAML, Ray packages.

Its data section, shown as below, provides feature engineering based on **arithmatic operation**. It allows the users
to have a statistic analysis on the data set as well as on the imputation result, which is supported by the combination
of **Monte Carlo simulation** and **hypothesis testing**.


Its models section provides both **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning** methods from
**Scikit-learn** framework, including four types of algorithms, regression, classification,
clustering, and dimensional reduction. Integrated with **FLAML** and **Ray** framework, it allows the users to run
AutoML easily, fastly and cost-effectively on the built-in supervised learning algorithms in our framework.

## Join Us :)
**The recruitment of research interns is ongoing !!!**

**Key Point: All things are done online, remote work (\*^▽^\*)**

**What can you learn?**
+ Learning the full cycle of data mining on tabular data, including the algorithms in regression,
classification, clustering, and decomposition.
+ Learning to be a qualified Python developer, including any Python programing contents towards data mining,
basic software engineering techniques like OOP developing, and cooperation tools like Git.

**What can you get?**  

+ Research internship proof and reference letter after working for > 200 hours.
+ Chance to pay a visit to Hangzhou, China, sponsored by ZJU Earth Data.
+ Chance to be guided by the experts from IT companies in Silicon Valley and Hangzhou.
+ Bonus depending on your performance. 

**Current Working Pattern:**
+ Online working and cooperation
+ Three weeks per working cycle -> One online meeting per working cycle
+ One cycle report (see below) per cycle - 5 mins to finish

Even if you are not familiar with topics above, but if you are interested in and have plenty of time to do it.
That's enough. We have a full-developed training system to help you, as a newbie of data mining or Python developer,
learn steps by steps with seniors until you can make a significant contribution to our project.
