## Install

## How to
Primarily use the handler to do database manipulation for you instead of directly edit the data objects. The handler is built to make manipulation of the objects even simpler. The Database object contains the actual connection to the database.

See the [example.py](example.py) file for a list of examples of functionality.
https://github.com/Michael-Yongshi/SQLiteManager/blob/master/unit_tests.py

The sqlite handler is aware of the working directory, if paths are not given it will work from the current working directory.
It prints the paths its using, so watch closely that its called from the correct one.

## Tests
Run test_handler.py in order to test the package.
