# Command Line ASCII Art Generator

ASCIIcli is a command line interface that is powered by Python3. You can generate ASCII art by importing an image and then selecting the character set that you want to generate with.  

## Installation & Building

### PIP

The easiest way to install ASCIIcli is by using the [PyPI library](https://pypi.org/project/asciicli/).  
You can run `pip install ASCIIcli` on any command-line with Python3 in order to install it.  

### Releases

If you are unable to use the PyPI library you can access ASCIIcli by going to our [releases page](https://github.com/mrq-andras/asciicli/releases).  
There you can download the .exe file and run the CLI by going to the folder that the program is downloaded in and running `.\asciicli`  

---

## Usage

`asciicli C:/full/path/to/your/image [-h] [-percent VALUE] [-set VALUE] [-gray VALUE] [-random] [-invert]`  
  
If you have downloaded the application through pip input the following command in the terminal:  
`asciicli C:/full/path/to/your/image -p 10 -s 1 -r`

If you are running the .exe package you will need to slightly alter the command by calling the exact folder of ASCIIcli  
`.\path\to\asciicli.exe C:/full/path/to/your/image` -p 10 -s 1 -r

Assuming the file is 1024x219, this command will generate a .txt file that is 21 lines long with each line taking up 201 characters using the character set to one. The `-s` variable is optional as the default character set is one. Random has been set to true and it will take the image from assets/input.jpg and generate a .txt file titled input-ascii.jpg in the same folder as the image.  

Random and Invert are will take effect when called upon with the -random/-r and -invert/-i arguments, whereas the Gray and Set arguments are all integers.
