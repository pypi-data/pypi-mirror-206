pysignald is a Python client for the excellent [signald](https://signald.org/) project, which in turn
is a command-line client for the Signal messaging service.

pysignald allows you to programmatically send and receive messages to Signal.

NOTE: Unfortunately, this library might be somewhat out of date or parts of it might not be working, as the upstream API
keeps changing, breaking compatibility. If you notice any breakage, MRs to fix it would be appreciated.


Installation
------------

You can install pysignald with pip:

```
$ pip install pysignald
```


Running
-------

Just make sure you have signald installed. Here's an example of how to use pysignald:


```python
from signald import Signal, Reaction

s = Signal("+1234567890")

# If you haven't registered/verified signald, do that first:
s.register(voice=False)
s.verify("sms code")

# If you want to set your display name, mobilecoin payments address (if using payments), or avatar, you can call set_profile:
s.set_profile(
    display_name="My user name",
    mobilecoin_address="...", # Base64-encoded PublicAddress, see https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/blob/master/api/proto/external.proto
    avatar_filename="/signald-data/avatar.png", # Must be accessible by signald
)

s.send(recipient="+1098765432", text="Hello there!")
s.send(recipient_group_id="YXNkZkFTREZhc2RmQVNERg==", text="Hello group!")

# Get the profile information of someone
profile_info = s.get_profile(recipient="+1098765432")
print(profile_info)

for message in s.receive_messages():
    print(message)
    s.react(Reaction("ðŸ¥³", message.source, message.timestamp), message.source["number"])

    # Send a read receipt notification which shows the message read checkmark on the receipient side
    s.send_read_receipt(recipient=message.source["number"], timestamps=[message.timestamp])

    # Echo the message back.
    s.send(recipient=message.source["number"], text=message.text)
```

You can also use the chat decorator interface:

```python
from signald import Signal

s = Signal("+1234567890")

@s.chat_handler("hello there", order=10)  # This is case-insensitive.
def hello_there(message, match):
    # Returning `False` as the first argument will cause matching to continue
    # after this handler runs.
    stop = False
    reply = "Hello there!"
    return stop, reply


# Matching is case-insensitive. The `order` argument signifies when
# the handler will try to match (default is 100), and functions get sorted
# by order of declaration secondly.
@s.chat_handler("hello", order=10)
def hello(message, match):
    # This will match on "hello there" as well because of the "stop" return code in
    # the function above. Both replies will be sent.
    return "Hello!"


@s.chat_handler("wave", order=20)
def react_with_waving_hand(message, match):
    # This will only react to the received message.
    # But it would be possible to send a reply and a reaction at the same time.
    stop = True
    reply = None
    reaction = "ðŸ‘‹"
    return stop, reply, reaction


@s.chat_handler(re.compile("my name is (.*)"))  # This is case-sensitive.
def name(message, match):
    return "Hello %s." % match.group(1)


@s.chat_handler("")
def catch_all(message, match):
    # This will only be sent if nothing else matches, because matching
    # stops by default on the first function that matches.
    return "I don't know what you said."

s.run_chat()
```

### Identity handling:

```python
from signald import Signal
from signald.types import TrustLevel

s = Signal("+1234567890")

# Revoke trust for all identities of a given number
for identity in s.get_identities("+1234001100"):
    s.trust(
        "+1234001100",
        identity.safety_number,
        TrustLevel.UNTRUSTED,
    )

# Generate QR code data for identity validation
ids = s.get_identities("+1234001177")
ids.sort(key=lambda x: x.added, reverse=True)
# prints base64 encoded validation code of the latest identity of the given number
print(ids[0].qr_code_data)
```
You can pipe the content of `ids[0].qr_code_data`  to `| base64 -D | qrencode -t ansi` to validate the identity via the Singal app QR scanner.


### Group information:
```python
from signald import Signal

s = Signal("+1234567890")

# list all groups and members
for group in s.list_groups():
    print(group.title)
    for member in group.members:
        print(member.get("uuid"))
```

Various
-------

pysignald also supports different socket paths:

```python
s = Signal("+1234567890", socket_path="/var/some/other/socket.sock")
```

It supports TCP sockets too, if you run a proxy. For example, you can proxy signald's UNIX socket over TCP with socat:

```bash
$ socat -d -d TCP4-LISTEN:15432,fork UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/signald/signald.sock
```

Then in pysignald:

```python
s = Signal("+1234567890", socket_path=("your.serveri.ip", 15432))
```
