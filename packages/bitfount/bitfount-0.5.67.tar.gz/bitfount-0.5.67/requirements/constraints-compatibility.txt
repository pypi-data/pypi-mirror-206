# This file contains pip package version constraints that are needed to ensure
# compatibility across the various requirements*.in files.
#
# This should only be used when we have an indirect dependency version clash
# (direct dependency clashes should be addressed in the requirements files or
# constraints-direct.txt).
#
# These should be checked regularly to see if they are still required.

# This version or higher introduces mypy compatibility
ipython>=8.8.0

# Need to ensure that the correct major version of protobuf is used if it's installed
protobuf>=4,<5
