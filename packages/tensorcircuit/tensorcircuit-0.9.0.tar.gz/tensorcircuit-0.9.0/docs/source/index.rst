TensorCircuit is an open source quantum circuit and algorithm simulation framework.

* It is built for human beings. ðŸ‘½

* It is designed for speed, flexibility and elegance. ðŸš€

* It is empowered by advanced tensor network simulator engine. ðŸ”‹

* It is implemented with industry-standard machine learning frameworks: TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch. ðŸ¤–

* It is compatible with machine learning engineering paradigms: automatic differentiation, just-in-time compilation, vectorized parallelism and GPU acceleration. ðŸ›
