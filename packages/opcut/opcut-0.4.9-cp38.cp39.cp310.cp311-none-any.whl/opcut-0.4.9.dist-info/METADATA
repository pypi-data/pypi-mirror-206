opcut
=====

`<https://opcut.kopic.xyz/>`_

`opcut` is cutting stock problem optimizer
(`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem`) utilizing multiple
panels and guillotine cuts (end-to-end cuts). This project includes:

    * multiple back-end optimizer implementations
    * command line front-end
    * REST service API (OpenAPI definition)
    * single-page web application front-end

Git repository is available at `<https://github.com/bozokopic/opcut.git>`_.

Public instance `<https://opcut.kopic.xyz/>`_ is constrained with limited
resources and should be used only for functionality evaluation purposes.
In case of complex and repetitive calculations, please consider running
self hosted instance.


Runtime requirements
--------------------

* python >=3.8

.. note::

    on Ubuntu, if pycairo is not available, additional
    ``apt install gcc pkg-config libcairo2-dev python3-dev`` is required


Install
-------

Archlinux
'''''''''

Opcut is available as
`opcut package <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opcut>`_ at AUR::

    $ yay -S opcut

Usage
-----

`opcut` command is interface for execution of three distinct actions:

    * `opcut calculate ...`

        Calculation of cutting stock problem. Input parameters and result is
        formated as JSON data (JSON, YAML or TOML).

    * `opcut generate ...`

        Generate output representation (SVG, PDF, ...) based on calculation
        result.

    * `opcut server ...`

        Run HTTP server providing single-page web application interface and
        OpenAPI interface.
        (default listening address is http://0.0.0.0:8080).

For additional command line arguments, run ``opcut --help`` or
``opcut <action> --help``.

JSON schema describing data structures is available at `<schemas/opcut.yaml>`_.

OpenAPI definition is available at `<schemas/openapi.yaml>`_.


`opcut calculate`
'''''''''''''''''

Example::

    $ opcut calculate --input-format yaml --output result.json << EOF
    cut_width: 1
    panels:
        panel1:
            width: 100
            height: 100
    items:
        item1:
            width: 10
            height: 10
            can_rotate: false
    EOF


`opcut generate`
''''''''''''''''

Example::

    $ opcut generate --output output.pdf result.json

installed together with other python dependencies by running::

    $ pip install -r requirements.pip.dev.txt

For listing available doit tasks, use::

    $ doit list

Default task::

    $ doit

creates wheel package inside `build` directory.
