## About

easy-learn is a high-level Python interface for automated machine learning (AutoML). While there are many AutoML libraries available each typically solves a niche area of the overall ML pipeline without providing a covering and approachable end-to-end system.

The aim of easy-learn is exactly that. Given a dataset, easy-learn will analyse types and distributions of attributes, preprocess, feature-engineer and ultimately train models to be used for further evaluation or inference.
