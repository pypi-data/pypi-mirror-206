           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

<h1 align="center">MkPosters</h1>

Create posters using Markdown. Supports icons, admonitions, and LaTeX mathematics.

At the moment it is restricted to the specific layout of two-columns-with-banner-at-the-top, as that's what I tend to use. (Pull requests are welcome if you want to make this tool more general.) The poster can be either portrait or landscape.

The library operates by parsing your Markdown into HTML, styling it with CSS, and then opening a webpage that you can export to PDF.

## Example

<img style="height: 400pt; width: auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrick-kidger/mkposters/main/imgs/diffrax.png" alt="Example poster">

The "source code" for this example is [here](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/mkposters/tree/main/examples/diffrax).

## Assumptions

Assumes you have:
- Linux (WSL is fine) or macOS
- Firefox
- Python

Compatibility with other operating systems is probably possible by switching out the version of Dart Sass being used internally.  
Compatibility with other browsers is unlikely.

You'll need to be relatively familiar with HTML and (S)CSS to make best use of MkPosters.

## Installation

```
pip install mkposters
```

## Usage instructions

1. Create the appropriate directory structure

```
foo/
    poster.md
    ...any other assets e.g. images...
```

2. Lay out your poster

`poster.md` should be formatted in three sections, with a literal "`--split--`" between each section.

```
...whatever you want in the banner at the top...

--split--

...whatever you want in the left column...

--split--

...whatever you want in the right column...
```

3. Build poster

Run from the directory containing `foo`:
```
bash> python -m mkposters foo
```

(The first time you do this MkPosters will attempt to automatically detect system architecture and install the appropriate required build of `dart-sass`. This was tested working on both an Apple M1 and Ubuntu x86_64 machine.)

4. View poster

Now open Firefox (*not* Chrome etc.) and navigate to `localhost:8000/poster.html`.

What you see will be based on the size of your current browser window and may differ from the PDF version. So next hit `Control-P` and select "Save to PDF". What you see in the print preview is what you'll actually end up with!

Make all your edits until you're happy with the result. Now let's save the result to PDF.

5. Save to PDF

Saving to PDF can be quite finickity, and in general depends on choice of browser etc. (For what it's worth the following is tested using Firefox on Windows 10 with `mkposters` running on Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL2.)

In the print dialog window we opened above:
- Destination: "Save to PDF". **Do not use "Microsoft Print to PDF".**
- Orientation: (portrait or landscape, as desired)
- Pages: Custom: 1
- Paper size: (whatever is desired; current styling works best on paper roughly A4 sized)
- Margins: None
- Options: uncheck "Print headers and footers"

**Once again, make sure you're using Firefox.** Using other browsers (e.g. Chrome) or other PDF exporters (e.g. WeasyPrint) can introduce a variety of issues, such as saving text as images (which are unselectable in the PDF, and appear slightly pixelated), missing parts of the styling, or having faded colours (looking at you, Chrome).

## Functionality

MkPosters comes with a few extra pieces of functionality built in.

#### Icons

Recalling that Markdown can embed HTML, then icons can be embedded via e.g.
```html
<img style="height: 20pt; width: 20pt" src="icons/fontawesome/brands/github.svg">
```
where the list of available icons is [here](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/mkposters/tree/main/mkposters/third_party/icons).

#### Mathematics

You can use LaTeX-formatted mathematics. This is done via

```
\\(inline math\\)
\\[display math\\]
```

Note the double backslash.

#### Admonitions

Admonitions can be added using the syntax

```markdown
!!! admonition_type "Your title here"

    Your text here
```

where `admonition_type` is any of [these](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#supported-types) types, e.g. `info`, `tip`, etc.

#### HTML

The Markdown format allows you use arbitrary HTML inside of it.

- The banner section often contains information (titles, authors, logos, URLs etc.) laid out in complicated ways. Directly writing HTML with embedded `style` attributes is simplest here. [See the start of this example.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrick-kidger/mkposters/main/examples/diffrax/poster.md)
- HTML can be (ab)used to modify spacing like so. (Analogous to those little `\vspace`s you definitely never use in LaTeX documents.) In this example we move the content up by 10 points.
```
<div style="margin-top: -10pt;">
...your content here...
</div>
```

## Future plans?

It'd be nice to support:
- Custom per-poster SCSS;
- Other poster layouts;
- Handling other paper sizes;
- Optionally automatically generating the PDF. (Practically speaking probably by automating the Firefox interaction through Selenium.)
- Reducing package size by not including all of the `mkposters/third_party/icons` directory by default?

Pull requests welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/mkposters/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
