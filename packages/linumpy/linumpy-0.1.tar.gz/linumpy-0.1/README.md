# Linumpy

**Linumpy** is the main library supporting research and development at the *Laboratoire d'Imagerie Num√©rique, Neurophotonique et Microscopie* ([LINUM]).

**Linumpy** contains tools and utilities to quickly work with serial histology and microscopy data. Those tools implement the recommended workflows and parameters used in the lab. The library and scripts can be installed locally by using:

```
pip install -e .
```

We highly recommend working in a [Python Virtual Environment].
