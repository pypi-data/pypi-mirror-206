## Installation 

To install the library: 

`pip install fly_tracker`

## Usage

The library takes the following arguments:

| Argument | Name | Type | Description
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| src | Source | string | Source City |
| dst | Destination | string |Destination City|
| price | Price | int |The threshold price that you want to set|
| date | Date | string | The date you want to fly on |

Run the following command:

`python fly_tracker --src src-city --dst dest-city --price price --date date`

Replace src-city, dest-city, price, and date with your desired values. This will start tracking the flight prices for the specified route.

## Example

`python fly_tracker --src "New York" --dst "Boston" --price 100 --date "12 May"`

This creates a 'Results_TimeStamp.csv' file with all airfares between New York and Boston on 12th May below 100$.
