## Introduction

***abspy*** is a Python tool for 3D *adaptive binary space partitioning* and beyond: an ambient 3D space is adaptively partitioned to form a linear cell complex with pre-detected planar primitives in a point cloud, where an adjacency graph is dynamically obtained. Though the tool is designed primarily to support compact surface reconstruction, it can be extrapolated to other applications as well.

## Key features

* Manipulation of planar primitives detected from point clouds
* Linear cell complex creation with adaptive binary space partitioning (a-BSP)
* Dynamic BSP-tree ([NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) graph) updated locally upon insertion of primitives
* Support of polygonal surface reconstruction from graph cuts
* Compatible data structure with [Easy3D](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/Easy3D) on point clouds, primitives, cell complexes and surfaces
* Robust Boolean spatial operations underpinned by the rational ring from [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)'s exact kernel

## Installation

### Install requirements

All dependencies except for [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) can be easily installed with [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenzhaiyu/abspy && cd abspy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optionally, install [pyglet](https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet) and [pyembree](https://github.com/adam-grant-hendry/pyembree) for better visualisation and ray-tracing, respectively:

```bash
pip install pyglet pyembree
```

### Install SageMath

For Linux and macOS users, the easiest is to install from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/):

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install sage
```

Alternatively, you can use [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) for faster parsing and package installation:

```bash
conda install mamba
mamba install sage
```

For Windows users, you may have to build SageMath from source or install all other dependencies into a [pre-built SageMath environment](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/binary.html).

### Install abspy

Preferably, ***abspy*** can be found and easily installed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/abspy/):

```bash
pip install abspy
```

Otherwise, you can install the pulled version locally:

```
pip install .
```

## Quick start

Here is an example of loading a point cloud in `VertexGroup` (`.vg`), partitioning the ambient space into candidate convexes, creating the adjacency graph, and extracting the outer surface of the object.

```python
import numpy as np
from abspy import VertexGroup, AdjacencyGraph, CellComplex

# load a point cloud in VertexGroup 
vertex_group = VertexGroup(filepath='points.vg')

# normalise the point cloud
vertex_group.normalise_to_centroid_and_scale()

# additional planes to append (e.g., the bounding planes)
additional_planes = [[0, 0, 1, -1], [1, 2, 3, -4]]

# initialise CellComplex from planar primitives
cell_complex = CellComplex(vertex_group.planes, vertex_group.bounds, vertex_group.points_grouped, build_graph=True, additional_planes=additional_planes)

# refine planar primitives
cell_complex.refine_planes()

# prioritise certain planes (e.g., vertical ones)
cell_complex.prioritise_planes(prioritise_verticals=True)

# construct CellComplex 
cell_complex.construct()

# print info on the cell complex
cell_complex.print_info()

# build adjacency graph of the cell complex
adjacency_graph = AdjacencyGraph(cell_complex.graph)

# assign weights (e.g., SDF values provided by neural network prediction) to graph 
weights_dict = adjacency_graph.to_dict(...)
adjacency_graph.assign_weights_to_n_links(cell_complex.cells, attribute='area_overlap', factor=0.001, cache_interfaces=True)
adjacency_graph.assign_weights_to_st_links(weights_dict)

# perform graph-cut to extract surface
_, _ = adjacency_graph.cut()

# save surface model to an OBJ file
adjacency_graph.save_surface_obj('surface.obj', engine='rendering')
```

Usage can be found at [API reference](https://abspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html). For the data structure of a `.vg`/`.bvg` file, refer to [VertexGroup](https://abspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vertexgroup.html).

## Misc

* **Why adaptive?**

The adaptive strategy significantly unburdens computations for cell complex creation, compared to the exhaustive counterpart, yet retaining meaningful space partitions.

Run the benchmark comparing the adaptive, the exhaustive, and SageMath's [hyperplane arrangements](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/discrete_geometry/sage/geometry/hyperplane_arrangement/arrangement.html):

```bash
python misc/benchmark.py
```

* **How can *abspy* be used for surface reconstruction?**

With a constructed cell complex, the surface can be addressed by graph cut &mdash; in between adjacent cells where one being *inside* and the other being *outside* &mdash;Â exactly where the cut is performed. For more information, refer to ***[Points2Poly](https://github.com/chenzhaiyu/points2poly)*** which wraps ***abspy*** for building surface reconstruction.
