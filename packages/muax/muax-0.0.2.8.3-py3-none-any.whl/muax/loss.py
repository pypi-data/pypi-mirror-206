def default_loss_fn(muzero_instance, params, batch):
    r"""
    Computes loss for MuZero model. 
    Uses `scalar_to_support` for reward `r` and n-step bootstrapping value `Rn`. A technique mentioned in the paper's Appendix.
    The loss is the sum of `cross_entropy(u, r)`, `cross_entropy(Rn, v)` and `cross_entropy(logits, pi)`, and is regularised by L2.

    Parameters
    ----------
    muzero_instance : An instance of `MuZero` class

    params : `muzero_instance.params`

        The parameters of each of the three neural networks(representation, prediction and dynamic)

    batch: An instance of `Transition`.

        A batch from `replay_buffer.sample`. For each `field` in batch, it is of the shape `[B, L, ...]`, 
        where `B` is the batch size, `L` is the length of the sample trajectory, the remaining demensions are the dimension of this `field`.
        For instance, the shape of `batch.r` could be `[32, 10]`, which represents there are 32 trajectories sampled, each has a length of 10,
        and the reward corresponding to each step is a scalar. And the `batch.obs` could be `[32, 10, 84, 84, 3]`, that is there are 32 trajectories sampled, 
        each has a length of 10, and the observation corresponding to each step is a `[84, 84, 3]` vector
    
    Returns
    -------
    loss: jnp.array. The loss calculated.
