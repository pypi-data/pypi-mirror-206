Description
===========

mubody is an astrodynamics open-source Python library focused on the
libration points and the dynamics of the multi-body regime from which
they emerge. Its aim is to be used as a tool for the design and the
analysis of space missions in the libration points. It has been
developed by students from the Technical University from Madrid (Spain).
