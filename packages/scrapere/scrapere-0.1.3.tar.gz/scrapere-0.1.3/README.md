# Scraping libary

This is a simple toolbox for scraping info from websites.

## Version 0.1.3 issues:
- There are no tests...
- scrap_phones() only works for spanish phone numbers
- scrap_emails() was generated by github copilot and has not been tried yet...

As this is my first python package, I might not mantain it so better try finding another one ;)
