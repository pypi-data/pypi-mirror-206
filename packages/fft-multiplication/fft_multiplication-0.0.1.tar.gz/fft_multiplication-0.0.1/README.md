# FFT Multiplication: An implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to multiply two polynomials efficiently.

## Introduction

`FFT Multiplication` is a simple, zero-configuration command-line static HTTP server.

## Installation:

#### Globally via `pip`

    pip install fft_multiplication

This will install `fft_multiplication` globally so that it can be imported into any python program.

## Usage:

```python
from fft_multiplication import multiply

p = [1, 1]
q = [1, 0]

print(multiply(p, q))
```

## Features

- Efficient polynomial multiplication using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm
- Comparison with the direct multiplication method
- Test cases to ensure correctness of the implementations
