        **DESCRIPTION**
        
        |
        
        
        ``bsd`` is a CLI, intended to be programmable, with a client program (bsd).
        It provides object persistence, an event handler and some basic code to load
        modules that can provide additional functionality.
        
        ``bsd`` uses object programming, object oriented programming without the
        oriented. Object programming is programming where the methods are seperated
        out into functions that use the object as the first argument of that funcion.
        This gives base class definitions a clean namespace to inherit from and to load
        json data into the object's __dict__. A clean namespace prevents a json loaded
        attribute to overwrite any methods.
        
        ``bsd`` stores it's data on disk where objects are time versioned and the
        last version saved on disk is served to the user layer. Files are JSON dumps
        and paths carry the type in the path name what makes reconstruction from
        filename easier then reading type from the object.
        
        ``bsd`` has some functionality, mostly feeding RSS feeds into a irc
        channel. It can do some logging of txt and take note of things todo.
        
        
        ``bsd`` is a contribution back to society, it is placed in the Public
        Domain.
