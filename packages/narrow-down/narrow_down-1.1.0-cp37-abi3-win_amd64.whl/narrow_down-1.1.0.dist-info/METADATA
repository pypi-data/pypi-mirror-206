Narrow Down offers a flexible but easy-to-use Python API to finding duplicates or similar documents also in very large datasets. It reduces the O(n²) problem of comparing all strings with each other to linear scale by using approximation algorithms like Locality Sensitive Hashing.

* GitHub repo: <https://github.com/chr1st1ank/narrow-down.git>
* Documentation: <https://chr1st1ank.github.io/narrow-down>


## Features

* Document indexing and search based on the Minhash LSH algorithm
* High performance thanks to a native extension module in Rust
* Easy-to-use API with automated parameter tuning
* Works with exchangeable storage backends. Currently implemented:
  * In-Memory
  * Cassandra / ScyllaDB 
  * SQLite
  * User defined backends (by implementing a small interface)
* Native asyncio interface

## Installation
The Python package can be installed with *pip*:
```shell
pip install narrow-down
```

### Extras

Some of the heavier functionality is available as *extra*:
```shell
pip install narrow-down[scylladb]   # Cassandra / ScyllaDB storage backend
```

## Similar projects
- [pylsh](https://github.com/mattilyra/LSH) offers a good implementation of the classic Minhash LSH scheme in Python and Cython. If you only need this and you don't need a database backend it can be a good choice.
- [Datasketch](https://github.com/ekzhu/datasketch) implements an interesting collection of different data sketching algorithms for similarity matching, cardinality estimation and k-nearest-neighbour search. The implementation is not highly optimized but very well usable, the documentation rich and multiple database backends can be used for some of the sketches
- [Milvus](https://milvus.io/) offers a full database stack for vector search, a different approach for fast searching. It can also be applied to text search when an embedding like Word2Vec or Bert is used to vectorize the text.
