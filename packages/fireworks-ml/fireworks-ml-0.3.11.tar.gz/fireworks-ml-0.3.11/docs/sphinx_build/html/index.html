<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Tensor algebra frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have made developing neural network based machine learning models surprisingly easy in the past few years. The flowgraph architecture that these are built around makes it simple to apply algebraic transforms such as gradients to tensor valued datasets with GPU optimization, such as in neural networks.</p>
<p>While these frameworks offer building blocks for constructing models, we often want tools to combine those blocks in reusable manners. Libraries such as Keras and Gluon are built on top of these computation frameworks to offer abstractions specific to certain types of neural networks that can be stacked together in layers. The Ignite library for PyTorch takes a more hands-on approach. It provides an ‘engine’ class that has event methods corresponding to the stages of a machine learning training process (before training, before epoch, before step, during step, after step, etc.). The developer writes functions for what should happen during each of these events (what happens during a training step, at the end of an epoch, etc.), and the engine then makes sure those functions are called at the correct times. On the other extreme, there are completely hands-off machine learning frameworks such as arya.ai and Google autoML that allow one to drag and drop elements and data to construct and train a neural network model.</p>
<p>Which of these approaches makes the most sense? For a researcher, control and flexibility are of paramount importance. Models should be easy to construct but allow one to step in wherever additional control is needed. This is particularly important because in research, one often wants to design models that cannot be expressed using simpler frameworks. For this reason, I prefer the combination of PyTorch + Ignite for deep learning.</p>
<p>However, these tools do not satisfy all of the needs of a deep learning pipeline. A pain point in all deep learning frameworks is data entry; one has to take data in its original form and morph it into the form that the model expects (tensors, TFRecords, etc.). This process can include acquiring the data from a database or an API call, formatting it, applying preprocessing transforms such as mapping text to vectors based on a vocabulary, and preparing mini batches for training. In each of these steps, one must be cognizant of memory, storage, bandwidth, and compute limitations. For example, if a dataset is too big to fit in memory, then it’s journey must be streamed or broken into chunks. In practice, dealing with these issues takes more time than developing the actual models. Hence, we are in a strange position where it’s easy to construct a bidirectional LSTM RNN with attention, but it’s hard to load in a corpus of text from a database to train a classifier with that RNN.</p>
<p>This is where Fireworks comes in. Fireworks is a python-first framework for performing the data processing steps of machine learning in a modular and reusable manner. It does this by moving data between objects called ‘Pipes’. A Pipe can represent a file, a database, or a transform. Each Pipe has an input Pipe and is itself an input to other Pipes, and as data flows from Pipe to Pipe, transforms are applied one at a time, creating a graph of data flow. Because each Pipe is independent, they can be stacked and reused in the future. Moreover, because Pipe are aware of their inputs, they can also call methods on their inputs, and this enables lazy evaluation of data transformations. Lastly, the means of communication between Pipes is represented by a Message object. A Message is essentially a (python) dict of arrays, lists, vectors, tensors, etc. It generalizes the functionality of a pandas dataframe to include the ability to store PyTorch tensors. This makes it easy to adapt traditional ML pipelines that use pandas and scikit-learn, because Messages behave like DataFrames. As a result, Fireworks is useful for any data processing task, and not just deep learning. It can be used for interacting with a database, constructing statistical models with pandas, and so much more.</p>

<div class="section" id="overview">
<h1>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Fireworks consists of a number of modules that are designed to work together to facilitate an aspect of deep learning and data processing.</p>
<p><strong>Message</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>“A dictionary of vectors and tensors”. This is a generalization of the idea of a DataFrame to be able to include PyTorch Tensors (this has been called a TensorFrame in other frameworks). This class also standardizes the means of communication between objects in Fireworks. Standardizing the means of communication makes it easier to write models that are reusable, because the inputs and outputs are always the same format.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Pipe</strong></p>
<p>A class that abstracts data access and transformation. Pipes can be linked together, allowing one to modularly construct a data pipeline. When data is accessed from such a pipeline, each Pipe will apply its own transformation one at a time and return the resulting output.</p>
<p><strong>Junction</strong></p>
<p>Whereas pipes can only have one input and are meant to represent a linear flow of information, Junctions can have multiple inputs and enable more complex information flows. These inputs are called components, and each Junction can implement its own logic for how it uses its components to return data that is requested.</p>
<p><strong>Models</strong></p>
<p>Models represent parameterizable transformations. In particular, PyTorch_Models represent transformations in the form of PyTorch Modules which can be inserted into a pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>MessageCache</strong></p>
<p>This class addresses the particular challenge of dealing with datasets that won’t fit in memory. A MessageCache behaves like a python cache that supports insertions, deletions, and accessions, except the underlying data structure is a message. This enables one to hold a portion of a larger dataset in memory  while virtually representing the entire dataset as a message.</p>
<p><strong>Hyperparameter Optimization</strong></p>
<p>This module takes an approach similar to Ignite, except for hyperparameter optimization. It provides a Junction class called Factory that has methods corresponding to the events in a hyperparameter training process (train, evaluate, decide on new parameters, etc.) that can be provided by the developer. In addition, training runs are treated as independent processes, enabling one to spawn multiple training runs simultaneously to evaluate multiple hyperparameters at once.</p>
<p><strong>Relational Database Integration</strong></p>
<p>Fireworks.database has Pipes that can read from and write to a database. Because it is based on python’s SQLalchemy library, it can be used to incorporate almost any relational database into a data analysis workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Collecting and Storing Experimental Runs / Metrics</strong>
In order to make machine learning research reproducible, we have to be able to store metadata and outputs associated with experiments. Fireworks.experiment implements an Experiment class that creates a folder and can generate file handles and SQLite tables residing in that folder to save information to. It can also store user defined metadata, all in a given experiment’s folder. This folder can be reloaded at any time in order to access the results of that experiment, regenerate plots, perform additional analyses, and so on.
Additionally, it is possible to save and load the state of an entire computation graph using the Fireworks.scaffold module. Pipes, Junctions, and Models each implement methods for serializing and de-serializing their internal state. These methods can be customized by the user and are compatible with PyTorch’s built-in save mechanisms. This allows you to save not just the internal parameters of a Model, but also a snapshot of the data used to train the model and the state of whatever preprocessing operations were performed, along with the outputs and logs that were produced. By saving the entire pipeline in this manner, it’s easier to reason about reproducibility of experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Not Yet Implemented / Roadmap Objectives</strong></p>
<p><strong>Plotting</strong></p>
<p>Generating plots is the primary means for analyzing and communicating the results of an experiment. We want to generate plots in such a way that we can go back later on and change the formatting (color scheme, etc.) or generate new plots from the data. In order to do this, plots must be generated dynamically rather than as static images. In addition, we want to create a robust means for displaying plots using a dashboard framework such as Plotly Dash. Tools such as Visdom are great for displaying live metrics from an experiment, but they are not designed to present hundreds of plots at once or to display those plots in a pleasing manner (such as with dropdown menus).
My goal is to create a dashboard that can display all information associated with a chosen experiment. It should include an SQLite browser, a plotly dashboard, a Visdom instance, and a Tensorboard instance. This should allow one to have all of the common visualization tools for machine learning in a single place.</p>
<p><strong>Dry Runs</strong></p>
<p>Certain steps in a data processing pipeline can be time consuming one-time operations that make it annoying to repeatedly start an experiment over. We want to set up means to ‘dry run’ an experiment in order to identify and fix bugs before running it on the full dataset. Additionally, we want to be able to set up checkpoints that enable one to continue an experiment after pausing it or loading it from a database.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed and Parallel Data Processing</strong></p>
<p>The idea of representing the data processing pipeline as a graph can naturally scale to parallel and distributed environments. In order to do make this happen, we need to write a scheduler that can call methods on Sources in parallel and add support for asynchronous method calls on Sources. For distributed processing, we have to write a tool for containerizing Sources and having them communicate over a container orchestration framework. Argo is a framework for Kubernetes we can use that is designed for this task.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Optimization of Data Pipeline</strong></p>
<p>Many sources have to occasionally perform time consuming O(1) tasks (such as precomputing indices corresponding to minibatches). Ideally, these tasks should be performed asynchronously, and the timing of when to perform them should be communicated by downstream sources. Adding the ability to communicate such timings would allow the pipeline to dynamically optimize itself in creative ways. For example, a CachingSource could prefetch elements into its cache that are expected to be called in the future to speed up its operation.</p>
<p><strong>Static Performance Optimization</strong></p>
<p>Right now, the focus is on establishing the interface and abstractions associated with Fireworks. There are many places where operations can be optimized using better algorithms, cython implementations of important code sections, and eliminating redundant code.</p>
