
## **Quantitative Investment Strategies: QIS** <a name="analytics"></a>

qis package implements analytics for visualisation of financial data, performance
reporting, analysis of quantitative strategies. 

qis package is split into 5 main modules with the 
dependecy path increasing sequentially as follows.

1. ```qis.utils``` is module containing low level utilities for operations with pandas, numpy, and datetimes.

2. ```qis.perfstats``` is module for computing performance statistics and performance attribution including returns, volatilities, etc.

3. ```qis.plots``` is module for plotting and visualization apis.

4. ```qis.models``` is module containing statistical models including filtering and regressions.

5. ```qis.portfolio``` is high level module for analysis, simulation, backtesting, and reporting of quant strategies.

```qis.examples``` contains scripts with illustrations of QIS analytics.

## **Contributions** <a name="contributions"></a>
If you are interested in extending and improving QIS analytics, 
please consider contributing to the library.

I have found it is a good practice to isolate general purpose and low level analytics and visualizations, which can be outsourced and shared, while keeping 
the focus on developing high level commercial applications.

There are a number of requirements:

- The code is [Pep 8 compliant](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

- Reliance on common Python data types including numpy arrays, pandas, and dataclasses.

- Transparent naming of functions and data types with enough comments. Type annotations of functions and arguments is a must.

- Each submodule has a unit test for core functions and a localised entry point to core functions.

- Avoid "super" pythonic constructions. Readability is the priority.

## **Examples** <a name="examples"></a>

### Visualization of price data <a name="price"></a>

The script is located in ```qis.examples.performances```

```python 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import yfinance as yf
import qis
from qis import PerfStat

# define tickers and fetch price data
tickers = ['SPY', 'QQQ', 'EEM', 'TLT', 'IEF', 'LQD', 'HYG', 'GLD']
prices = yf.download(tickers, start=None, end=None)['Adj Close'][tickers].dropna()

# plotting price data with minimum usage
fig = qis.plot_prices(prices=prices)
```
![image info](qis/examples/figures/perf1.PNG)
```python 
# 2-axis plot with drawdowns using sns styles
with sns.axes_style("darkgrid"):
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 7))
    qis.plot_prices_with_dd(prices=prices, axs=axs)
```
![image info](qis/examples/figures/perf2.PNG)
```python 
# plot risk-adjusted performance table with excess Sharpe ratio
ust_3m_rate = yf.download('^IRX', start=None, end=None)['Adj Close'].dropna() / 100.0
# set parameters for computing performance stats including returns vols and regressions
perf_params = qis.PerfParams(freq='M', freq_reg='Q', rates_data=ust_3m_rate)
fig = qis.plot_ra_perf_table(prices=prices,
                             perf_columns=[PerfStat.TOTAL_RETURN, PerfStat.PA_RETURN, PerfStat.VOL, PerfStat.SHARPE,
                                           PerfStat.SHARPE_EXCESS, PerfStat.MAX_DD, PerfStat.MAX_DD_VOL,
                                           PerfStat.SKEWNESS, PerfStat.KURTOSIS],
                             title=f"Risk-adjusted performance: {qis.get_time_period_label(prices, date_separator='-')}",
                             perf_params=perf_params)
```
