ASCE
ASCE is a simple program that operates on matrices. Some of the operations are:

add
subtract
multiply
triangle_inf
triangle_sup
determinant
trace
inverse
The purpose of this project is to find an algorithm that can multiply matrices with a better time complexity than the normal code (Strassen).

Note: These functions have been implemented in a class called "matrix". Therefore, before calling any function, we need to write matrix.function(), except for multiplication, addition, and subtraction, which can be called using the standard mathematical operations +, -, *.
