    Class to launch malware executables.

    This class provides a simple interface to run malware executables, killing the process if it runs for too long.

    Attributes:
        filepath (str): The path to the malware executable.
        timeout (float): The time in seconds before the malware process is forcefully terminated.

    Methods:
        run(): Launches the malware executable and waits for it to complete, with a timeout specified by the `timeout`
        attribute. Returns `True` if the process exited on its own, and `False` if it had to be forcefully terminated.

    Example:
        >>> launcher = MalwareLauncher('samples/malware1', timeout=1)
        >>> launcher.run() # Returns True is malware executed successfully.

        False

    Todo:
        Make `Malware` its own internal class.
