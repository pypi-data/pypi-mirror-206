class HTTPFileReader(io.BytesIO):
    """
    Acts file-like for files hosted on an HTTP server readably in binary mode.
    Provides `readable`, `writable`, `seekable`, `tellable`.
    Implements `read`, `readinto`, `seek`, `tell`
    Prohibits `write`, `writelines`, readline`, `readlines`, `truncate`
    Also implements `open`, `close`, `closed`, `__repr__`, `__enter__`, and `__exit__`

    This class can be used directly with ZipFile or TarFile, as follows:

    with requests.Session() as session:
        with HTTPFileReader(url="https://gitlab.com/files.zip?inline=false", session=session) as hfr:
            with zipfile.ZipFile(file=hfr, mode="r") as zf:

    with requests.Session() as session:
        with HTTPFileReader(url="https://gitlab.com/files.tar?inline=false", session=session) as hfr:
            with tarfile.open(fileobj=hfr, mode="r") as tf:

    with httpx.Client() as session:
        with HTTPFileReader(url="https://gitlab.com/files.zip?inline=false", session=session) as hfr:
            with zipfile.ZipFile(file=hfr, mode="r") as zf:

    with httpx.Client() as session:
        with HTTPFileReader(url="https://gitlab.com/files.tar?inline=false", session=session) as hfr:
            with tarfile.open(fileobj=hfr, mode="r") as tf:

    `close` takes no real action.  The requests.Session is managed externally, and there is no file descriptor or
    buffer.

    Ranged queries return `206 Partial Content`.
    Invalid ranges return `416 Range Not Satisfiable`.
    If the service does not process Ranged data, it returns `200 OK` and presents the entire document.
    Dynamic values of the target file may not be supported.
    Dynamic values of the URL parameters or headers are not supported.
    github and gitlab both support Ranged queries for git project files.

    This class is not thread-safe; no method is idempotent, all of them affect the object state.  However, since the
    underlying files are all read-only, multiple concurrent instances of this class is allowed.
