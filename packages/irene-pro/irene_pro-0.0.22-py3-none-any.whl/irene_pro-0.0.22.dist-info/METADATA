# 'irene-pro'



This is my customized user interface which is rooted from tkinter package.

nothing big that I did from here that is different from what already in tkinter, but I rather set my default parameters and 

styles for those rooted to ttk, example Combobox.



this is the first version, and later I will keep making extra-improvement including adding default icons to buttons and other

cool stuffs until it will be large package or framework in coming years.



=========how to use the package======

from irene-pro import widgets, logic



button = widgets.btn(master = root, text = 'send')

button.pack(side = LEFT)
