    'long_description': "# 🧿 `safer`: A safer writer 🧿\n\nAvoid partial writes or corruption!\n\n`safer` wraps file streams, sockets, or a callable, and offers a drop-in\nreplacement for regular old `open()`.\n\n## Quick summary\n\n### A tiny example\n\n    import safer\n\n    with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:\n        fp.write('one')\n        print('two', file=fp)\n        raise ValueError\n        # filename was not written.\n\n\n### How to use\n\nUse [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip) to install `safer` from the command\nline: `pip install safer`.\n\nTested on Python 3.4 - 3.11.  An old Python 2.7 version\nis [here](https://github.com/rec/safer/tree/v2.0.5).\n\nSee the Medium article [here](https://medium.com/@TomSwirly/%EF%B8%8F-safer-a-safer-file-writer-%EF%B8%8F-5fe267dbe3f5)\n\n### The details\n\n`safer` helps prevent programmer error from corrupting files, socket\nconnections, or generalized streams by writing a whole file or nothing.\n\nIt does not prevent concurrent modification of files from other threads or\nprocesses: if you need atomic file writing, see\nhttps://pypi.org/project/atomicwrites/\n\nIt also has a useful `dry_run` setting to let you test your code without\nactually overwriting the target file.\n\n* `safer.writer()` wraps an existing writer, socket or stream and writes a\n  whole response or nothing\n\n* `safer.open()` is a drop-in replacement for built-in `open` that\n  writes a whole file or nothing\n\n* `safer.closer()` returns a stream like from `safer.write()` that also\n  closes the underlying stream or callable when it closes.\n\n* `safer.dump()` is like a safer `json.dump()` which can be used for any\n  serialization protocol, including Yaml and Toml, and also allows you to\n  write to file streams or any other callable.\n\n* `safer.printer()` is `safer.open()` except that it yields a\n  a function that prints to the stream.\n\nBy default, `safer` buffers the written data in memory in a `io.StringIO`\nor `io.BytesIO`.\n\nFor very large files, `safer.open()` has a `temp_file` argument which\nwrites the data to a temporary file on disk, which is moved over using\n`os.rename` if the operation completes successfully.  This functionality\ndoes not work on Windows.  (In fact, it's unclear if any of this works on\nWindows, but that certainly won't.  Windows developer solicted!)\n\n\n### Example: `safer.writer()`\n\n`safer.writer()` wraps an existing stream - a writer, socket, or callback -\nin a temporary stream which is only copied to the target stream at close(), and\nonly if no exception was raised.\n\nSuppose `sock = socket.socket(*args)`.\n\nThe old, dangerous way goes like this.\n\n    try:\n        write_header(sock)\n        write_body(sock)   # Exception is thrown here\n        write_footer(sock)\n     except Exception:\n        write_error(sock)  # Oops, the header was already written\n\nWith `safer` you write all or nothing:\n\n    try:\n        with safer.writer(sock) as s:\n            write_header(s)\n            write_body(s)  # Exception is thrown here\n            write_footer(s)\n     except Exception:\n        write_error(sock)  # Nothing has been written\n\n### Example: `safer.open()` and json\n\n`safer.open()` is a a drop-in replacement for built-in `open()` except that\nwhen used as a context, it leaves the original file unchanged on failure.\n\nIt's easy to write broken JSON if something within it doesn't serialize.\n\n    with open(filename, 'w') as fp:\n        json.dump(data, fp)\n        # If an exception is raised, the file is empty or partly written\n\n`safer` prevents this:\n\n    with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:\n        json.dump(data, fp)\n        # If an exception is raised, the file is unchanged.\n\n`safer.open(filename)` returns a file stream `fp` like `open(filename)`\nwould, except that `fp` writes to memory stream or a temporary file in the\nsame directory.\n\nIf `fp` is used as a context manager and an exception is raised, then the\nproperty `fp.safer_failed` on the stream is automatically set to `True`.\n\nAnd when `fp.close()` is called, the cached data is stored in `filename` -\n*unless* `fp.safer_failed` is true.\n\n### Example: `safer.printer()`\n\n`safer.printer()` is similar to `safer.open()` except it yields a function\nthat prints to the open file - it's very convenient for printing text.\n\nLike `safer.open()`, if an exception is raised within its context manager,\nthe original file is left unchanged.\n\nBefore.\n\n    with open(file, 'w') as fp:\n        for item in items:\n            print(item, file=fp)\n        # Prints lines until the first exception\n\nWith `safer`\n\n    with safer.printer(file) as print:\n        for item in items:\n            print(item)\n        # Either the whole file is written, or nothing\n\n\n### [API Documentation](https://rec.github.io/safer#safer--api-documentation)\n",
