# Available models

Name          | Usage
--------------|----------------------------------------
Naive         | `from fold_models import Naive`
NaiveSeasonal | `from fold_models import NaiveSeasonal`
MovingAverage | `from fold_models import MovingAverage`
AR            | `from fold_models import AR`
ARIMA         | `from fold_models import ARIMA`

# Installation

- Prerequisites: `python >= 3.7` and `pip`

- Install from pypi:
  ```
  pip install fold-models
  ```
- Depending on what model you'd like to wrap, you can either install the library directly or run
   ```
  pip install "fold-models[<your_library_name>]"
  ```

# Quickstart




You can quickly train your chosen models and get predictions by running:

```python
  from fold import ExpandingWindowSplitter, train_evaluate
  from fold.utils.dataset import get_preprocessed_dataset
  from fold_models import Naive

  X, y = get_preprocessed_dataset(
      "weather/historical_hourly_la", target_col="temperature", shorten=1000
  )
  model = Naive()
  splitter = ExpandingWindowSplitter(initial_train_window=0.2, step=50)

  scorecard, predictions, trained_pipeline = train_evaluate(model, X, y, splitter)
```

## Licence & Usage

We want to **bring much-needed transparency, speed and rigour** to the process of creating Time Series ML pipelines, while also building a sustainable business, that can support the ecosystem in the long-term.
Fold's licence is inbetween [source-available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) and a traditional commercial software licence. It requires a paid licence for any commercial use, after the initial, 30 day trial period.

We also want to contribute to open research by giving free access to non-commercial, research use of `fold`.
