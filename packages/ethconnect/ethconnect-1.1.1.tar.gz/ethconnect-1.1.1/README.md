# ETH-Connect Python SDK

## Overview

Ethereum accounts, signatures, and transactions have an additional layer of complexity over traditional cryptographic keys and signatures. [Zymbit](https://www.zymbit.com/)'s ETH-Connect SDK aims to abstract away this complexity, enabling you to seamlessly integrate with Ethereum and EVM compatible chains without having to deal with their technical intricacies.

**NOTE:** Only compatible with [HSM6](https://www.zymbit.com/hsm6/), [SCM](https://www.zymbit.com/scm/), and [SEN](https://www.zymbit.com/secure-compute-node/)

## Installation
