DESCRIPTION
===========

Hi!

    This is my first Python module that was made 4 learning.

    To import it in your code sucsessfully u need 2 write this:

>  from catnapmodule import chat

    Then, u can use either functions of this module that can say u "hello",
     and show u, who is author of it.

    Enjoy!^^~
