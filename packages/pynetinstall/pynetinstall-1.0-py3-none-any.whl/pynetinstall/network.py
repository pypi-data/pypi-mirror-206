    `Subclass of socket.socket`

    This object represents the UDP connection to the Mikrotik Routerboard

    It handles the reading/writing between the interfaces

    Attributes
    ----------

    mac : bytes
        The MAC Address of the `interface_name` Interface of the Raspberry

    MAX_ERRORS : int
        How often a Function gets repeated before it raises an error
    MAX_BYTES_RECV : int
        The amount of bytes to receive at once

    Methods
    -------

    _get_source_mac() -> None
        Get the `mac` Address of the Raspberry
    
    read(state) -> tuple
        Read data from the Connection

    write(data, state, recv_addr=("255.255.255.255", 5000)) -> None
        Write `data` to the Connection

    get_interface_info() -> tuple
        Resolve some information about the Interface
